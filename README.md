# Inventory management

This is an aplication that keeps track of all items that are possessed by users.

There are 2 major roles:

- User role:
  - can request a new object
  - can return an object from his inventory
  - can see his inventory

- Admin role: 
  - can do everything that the user can do
  - can see all user inventories
  - receives all the requests from users


All the users and their inventory will be saved in a database.
